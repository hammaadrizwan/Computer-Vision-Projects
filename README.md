# Computer Vision Projects

Welcome to the Computer Vision Projects repository! This repository houses a collection of projects focusing on computer vision applications across various domains. From image preprocessing to object detection, each project follows a systematic process to extract meaningful insights from visual data. Below, you'll find an overview of the computer vision process and information about this repository.

## Computer Vision Process:

### 1. Image Acquisition:
Image acquisition involves obtaining visual data from various sources, such as cameras, satellites, or digital archives. The quality and resolution of the images collected are critical for accurate analysis and interpretation.

### 2. Image Preprocessing:
Image preprocessing encompasses techniques to enhance the quality and usability of raw images. This may include tasks such as noise reduction, image denoising, color correction, resizing, and normalization.

### 3. Feature Extraction:
Feature extraction involves identifying relevant patterns, structures, or attributes in the images that are essential for analysis. This step may include extracting edges, textures, shapes, or keypoints using techniques like edge detection, convolutional filters, or feature descriptors.

### 4. Computer Vision Algorithms:
Computer vision algorithms enable the analysis and interpretation of visual data to perform tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, and recognition. These algorithms may include traditional computer vision techniques, deep learning models, or a combination of both.

### 5. Model Training and Evaluation:
Model training involves feeding labeled data into machine learning or deep learning algorithms to learn patterns and make predictions. Evaluation measures the performance of the trained models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.

### 6. Visualization and Interpretation:
Visualization techniques help interpret the results of computer vision analysis by providing visual representations of findings. This may include heatmaps, bounding boxes, segmentation masks, or overlaying annotations on images to highlight important features.
